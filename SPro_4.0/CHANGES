This document describes the changes in SPro between successive
releases.

Changes from Spro 3.3.1 to 4.0
==============================

SPro 4.0 is *not* compatible with previous releases and exhibits major
changes in its structure. The main difference is the introduction of
feature streams (much alike the signal streams used for input). This
new feature I/O mechanisms enables the processing of continuous (or
very large) audio streams.

As introducing feature streams required a *major* redesign of the
source code, all the library files have been profondly modified and,
to avoid confusions, old spro_*.c names have been changed. Aslo, the
SPRO FEATURE FILE FORMAT HAS CHANGED to accomodate for streams
(e.g. number of frames unknown)...

It is impossible to describe all the changes bteween releases 3.3.1
and 4.0 but here are the main ones:

  - feature I/O via feature streams
  - redefined SPro feature file format (included the addition of an
    optional variable length ASCII header)
  - added LSF computation in slpc
  - added normalization qualifier (R)
  - delta, delta-delta, CMS can be computed directly in the main tools

Changes from SPro 3.3 to 3.3.1
==============================

Changed signal input mechanism to enable streaming so that we can read
big files without trusting the memory. Release 3.3.1 is fully
compatible with release 3.3 (except for the library signal I/O
functions). This release also introduces the concept of feature
buffers as a preparation to the migration to releases 4.x. Many
functionnalities added to scopy (scaling, bin extraction, linear
transform, etc.).

Changes from SPro 3.2 to 3.3
============================

SPro 3.3 is *not* compatible with previous releases. This is mainly
due to the introduction of a new, GPL-distributable FFT algorithm. The
current release is back to the stand-alone philosophy and no more
external libraries are needed. Configuration and installation now made
easy through automake and autoconf.

The list of changes is:

  - replaced numerical recipes FFT algorithm with a distributable one

  - implemented kernel based transforms for FFT and DCT 

  - removed libgg dependencies (using GNU getopt for option parsing)

  - added autoconf/automake stuff

  - added windowed CMS

  - corrected major bug in band-limited filter-bank analysis

  - changed some option switches in slpc to have uniform letters
    accross all tools

Changes from SPro 3.1 to 3.2
============================

SPro 3.2 is fully compatible with version 3.1 and only minor
corrections and add-ons were made. Ascending compatibility is only
true for the runtimes and for the algorithms but two function
prototypes were changed in spro.h.

The list of modifications is:

  - long option names were added to all runtimes (now require version
    2.2 of libgg)

  - tracing has been simplified,

  - energy scale factor option added to related tools,

  - frequency range limiting in FFT based spectral analysis

  - bug in the computation of the $\Delta\Delta$ energy has been

  - corrected ($\Delta\Delta$E was previously computed as $\Delta$E).

Changes from SPro 3.0 to 3.1
============================

The organization changed from SPro 3.0. The former spro_util.* codes
are now part of the libgg 2.1 library and spro~3.1 requires that
library.  This library also provides an error reporting function as
well as some standard error codes.

The FFT algorithm was changed to make it faster. It was previously
based on Nielsen's implementation of the algorithm. The new version
was adapted from the real FFT function described in the Numerical
Recipes in C (http://cfatab.harvard.edu/nr/bookc.html). In SPro~3.0,
the FFT was done on 1024 points and it is now done on 512 points.
Current version of sfbank is about 5~times faster than the previous
one.

The computation of the $\Delta$ coefficients slightly changed at the
boundary (the boundary frames are now repeated instead of being
avoided).

Known bugs have been corrected, principally concerning the cepstral
mean subtraction and error reporting is now better. Note that for a
better error reporting, many function prototypes changed so that some
tools developed with the previous version may be adapted before they
are compatible with SPro 3.1. The order of the enumeration for
datakind_t also changed so that when using slist with old data file,
the data kind printed on screen may not be the correct one.

The SPHERE compatibility is also a new feature of SPro 3.1.
