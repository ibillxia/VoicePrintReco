I.  Introduction to SPHERE

SPeech HEader REsources (SPHERE) is a software package developed by
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Automated
Speech Recognition Group to provide an interface to NIST
SPHERE-formatted speech waveform files.  (The acronym, SPHERE, has now
come to represent the format of the files as well as the software
package.)  

The SPHERE package contains two primary user-oriented software
components:

	1.  C-language programmer interface library

	2.  C-language system-level file manipulation utilities

The C-language programmer interface library has been developed to
provide a simple, intuitive interface to access and manipulate SPHERE
files.  The library has been specifically designed to mimic the syntax
and functionality of standard C-language file I/O functions.
Functions are provided to open, close, read, and write SPHERE files.
C-like header field manipulation functions have been included as well.

The system-level file manipulation utilities have been written using
the SPHERE library and provide command-line-level manipulation of
SPHERE files as well as functional examples of the usage of the SPHERE
libraries.

Where former versions of SPHERE provided only speech file header
access, Version 2.0 provides waveform access as well in both the
C-language programmer interface and system-level utilities.  Embedded
u-law, shorten, and wavpack compression/decompression is also
supported.



II.  C-language Programmer Interface Library.

    The SPHERE interface library functions provide a high-level
C-program interface to access and manipulate SPHERE-formatted files.
Many of the interface functions have been designed specifically 
to mimic standard C-language I/O functions.  Functions are 
included to provide SPHERE file access and separate manipulation
of file headers and bodies (waveforms). The functions have been
logically divided into five broad types:

	1.  File access functions (open and close SPHERE FILES)
	2.  Header manipulation functions
	3.  Waveform I/O and conversion functions
	4.  File I/O error status functions
	5.  Data (waveform) buffer allocation/deallocation functions


1.  File access functions:

   SPHERE file access is achieved via the 'sp_open' function.  The
'sp_open' function is analogous to the C-language 'fopen' function and
controls the opening of files.  Upon opening for read operations, a
SPHERE file structure is formed and the header is loaded.  For
write operations, a SPHERE file structure is formed and an empty
header is created.

   The 'sp_close' function is analogous to the C-language 'fclose' function
and closes the specified SPHERE file and frees up associated allocated
memory.


2.  Header manipulation functions:

   Opened SPHERE header structures are manipulated via a set of header
field functions to retrieve, write, and delete fields.  The function,
'sp_h_get_field', is used to retrieve the contents of the three types
of SPHERE fields.  Likewise, the function, 'sp_h_set_field', is used
to establish the contents of the three types of SPHERE fields.  These
functions are somewhat analogous to the C-language 'gets' and 'puts'
functions.  The function, 'sp_h_delete_field', is used to remove a
field from a header. 

   The function, 'sp_copy_header', is used to copy the header of an
opened SPHERE header to another opened SPHERE header.


3.  Waveform I/O and conversion functions

   A set of three functions has been established to handle waveform
I/O.  The first, 'sp_read_data', is used to load a block of waveform
data from a SPHERE file into memory.  This function is analogous to
the C-language 'fread' function.  Likewise, the function,
'sp_write_data', is used to flush a block of waveform data in memory
to SPHERE file and is analogous to the C-language 'fwrite' function.
The function, 'sp_set_data_mode', is used to change the default
behavior of 'sp_read_data' and 'sp_write_data' and controls such
variables as the conversion of waveform encodings and the byte order
during I/O.

Currently, only block-style sequential file access is supported.


4.  File I/O error status functions

   The functions, 'sp_eof' and 'sp_error', have been added to
provide file I/O status information analogous to the C-language
'feof' and 'ferror' functions.

5.  Data (waveform) buffer allocation/deallocation functions

    The functions, 'sp_data_alloc' and 'sp_data_free' have been added
to allocate and de-allocate memory and create data structures to hold
waveform data.  The functions use the header information to compute
the size required for the buffers.
	


The following sub-sections contain a detailed description template for
each function.  The templates are comprised of the following fields:

	Description - Brief general description of the purpose of the function
	Syntax - Function type and syntax including argument list
	Arguments - Description of arguments passed to the function
	Remarks - General comments and advisories regarding the function
	Return Value - Interpretation of the return values of the function
	See Also - List of related functions


II.A   File Access Functions


II.A.1 sp_open()

Description:

    Opens a SPHERE-formatted file and returns a SPHERE file pointer to
    the opened file.

Syntax:

    struct SP_FILE *sp_open(char *filename, char *mode)
	
Arguments:

    sp_open opens the file named by the string, 'filename', as
    instructed by the string, 'mode'.  

    The 'mode' string has the following values:

	"r[v]" -> Open a SPHERE file specified by the string, 'filename',
                  for reading.

	"w[v]" -> Open a SPHERE file specified by the string, 'filename',
                  for writing.

Remarks:

    Although a checksum is always generated upon completion of
    reading or writing any SPHERE file, an extra checksum verification
    may be performed using the optional 'v' modifier to
    'r' and 'w'.

    'rv' Checksum Verification:

    If a file is opened for read operations with the checksum
    verification flag, the checksum is verified before the
    file is made available for read operations.  Normally, the
    checksum is verified upon completion of reading a file.

    'wv' Checksum Verification:
   
    If a file is opened for write operations with the checksum
    verification flag, after a file is written, it is re-read and
    the checksum is verified.  Normally, if a checksum is present in the 
    file header before initiating write operations, then the existing
    checksum is verified against a checksum generated upon closing
    the file (with sp_close).  If a checksum is not present in the
    file header before initiating write operations, then a initial
    checksum is computed and no checksum verification takes placed.
    
    The 'filename' option may be '-' to signify stdin or stdout for
    files opened for read or write operations respectively.  As a special case,
    files opened in this manner do need to have a 'sample_count' field present
    in the header.  If the file is opened for read operations, the
    'sp_read_data()' function will read data until End-of-File is detected.
    If the file is opened for write operations, a flag value is placed
    in the output header so as to allow pipe-lined SPHERE operations to 
    work together.

Return Value:

    Returns a pointer to an opened SP_FILE structure.  If an error
    occurs during the open, returns a null pointer to a SP_FILE
    structure, "(SP_FILE *)0".

II.A.2 sp_close()

Description:

    Closes an opened SPHERE-formatted file.

Syntax:

    int sp_close(SP_FILE *sp)
	
Arguments:

    sp_close closes the file pointed to by 'sp'.  

Remarks:

    Upon closing the file, '*sp' sp_close frees the memory allocated
for the file buffer.

Return Value:

    Returns 100 or greater on failure, otherwise returns a zero.

    sp_read_data(), sp_write_data(), sp_set_data_mode(), sp_open()



II.B   Header Manipulation Functions

II.B.1 sp_h_get_field()

Description:

    Gets the specified header field value from an opened SPHERE file
header.

Syntax:

    int sp_h_get_field(SP_FILE *sp_file, char *field_name,
                       int field_type, void **field_value)

Arguments:

    sp_h_get_field copies the header field named by, 'field_name', of
type, 'field_type', from the opened SPHERE file pointed to by
'sp_file', to address pointed to by 'field_value'.

Remarks:

        Permitted        Library Defined            Field
    field_type values:        C-Types:           Definitions
    ------------------   ---------------         -----------	
       T_STRING           SP_STRING        string field type [char *]
       T_INTEGER   	  SP_INTEGER       integer field type [long]
       T_REAL             SP_REAL          real field type [double]


Note: in the case of a string field type (T_STRING), sp_h_get_field()
allocates sufficient dynamic memory for the string to be copied.  The
copied string is a NULL terminated sequence of characters.  It is the
programmer's responsibility to deallocate this memory using the
C-Language 'free()' function when the string is no longer needed.

In order to avoid mis-typing of header values, the SPHERE library has a
'typedef' for each of the header field types.

Return Value:

    sp_h_get_field() returns a 0 upon success, 1 to 99 for a warning,
and 100 or greater for an error.

See Also:

    sp_open()


II.B.2 sp_h_set_field()

Description:

    Sets the specified header field value in an opened SPHERE file
header.

Syntax:

    int sp_h_set_field(SP_FILE *sp_file, char *field_name, 
                       char* field_type, void *field_value)
	
Arguments:

    sp_h_set_field sets the header field value named by, 'field_name',
of type, 'field_type', in the opened SPHERE file pointed to by
'sp_file' with the value, 'field_value'.

Remarks:

        Permitted        Library Defined            Field
    field_type values:        C-Types:           Definitions
    ------------------   ---------------         -----------	
       T_STRING           SP_STRING        string field type [char *]
       T_INTEGER   	  SP_INTEGER       integer field type [long]
       T_REAL             SP_REAL          real field type [double]

    If the specified header field, 'field_name', does not exist in the
opened SPHERE file header, then the field is created.

Note: If a file is opened for write (using 'sp_open'), then this
function may only be called before using 'sp_write_data'.  Also, the
fields, 'sample_coding', 'sample_byte_format', 'sample_count',
'sample_n_bytes', 'sample_checksum', are set automatically by the
function, 'sp_set_data_mode', and should not be set manually if
'sp_set_data_mode' has been called.

In order to avoid mis-typing of header values, the SPHERE library has a
'typedef' for each of the header field types.

Return Value:
    sp_h_get_field() returns a 0 upon success, 1 to 99 for a warning,
and 100 or greater for an error.

See Also:
    sp_open()


II.B.3 sp_h_delete_field()

Description:

    Deletes the specified header field from an opened SPHERE file
header.

Syntax:

    int sp_h_delete_field(SP_FILE *sp_file, char *field_name)
	
Arguments:

    sp_h_delete_field deletes the header field named by,
'field_name', in the opened SPHERE file pointed to by 'sp_file'.

Remarks:

    If the specified header field to be deleted, 'field_name', does
not exist in the opened SPHERE file header, sp_h_delete_field() will
not complain, but will return a special value (see below).  Return
Value:

Return Value:

    sp_h_delete_field() returns a 0 on success, a 1 if the header
field does not exist, and a 100 or greater on error.

See Also:
    sp_open(), sp_h_set_field(), sp_h_get_field()


II.B.4  sp_copy_header()

Description:

    Copies the SPHERE header fields and their values from a source
header pointed by an SP_FILE pointer to a destination header pointed
to by another SP_FILE pointer.  Overwrites any existing fields common
to both the source and destination headers.

Syntax:

    int sp_copy_header(SP_FILE *source_sp, SP_FILE *destination_sp)
	
Arguments:

    sp_copy_header copies the fields and their values from the header
pointed to by 'source_sp' to the header pointed to by 'destination_sp'.

Return Value:

    sp_copy_header() returns a zero on success, and 100 or greater
on error.

See Also:
    sp_open(), sp_close()


II.C   Waveform I/O Functions

II.C.1 sp_read_data()

Description:
   
    Reads blocks of waveform data from an opened SPHERE file.

Syntax:

    /* New syntax for SPHERE version 2.2 or later              */
    int sp_read_data(void *ptr, size_t n, SP_FILE *sp_file)

    /* Syntax prior to SPHERE version 2.2, still supported for */
    /* backwards compatibility                                 */
    int sp_read_data(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t n, SP_FILE *sp_file)


Arguments:

    Reads 'n' elements from the waveform data section of the opened
SPHERE file pointed to by 'sp_file'.  An element is defined to be the
sample values of all channels for a particular sample number (common
time point).  The function performs the read (including any
conversions as necessary) to format the data according to the first
encoding specified in the header field, 'sample_coding'.  This
excludes subsequent encodings used on the stored waveform such as
compression, etc.

   The 'ptr' argument can be either a linear array of interleaved
channel samples, or a 2-dimensional array of non-interleaved channel
samples, with each channel contained in a separate array.  Either data
structure can be created by a call to the 'sp_data_alloc' function.
The form of the data structure is determined by the mode string passed
to the 'sp_set_data_mode' function.  By default, the function expects
the data to be structured in a linear array.  To change the format to
a multi-channel 2-dimensional array, use the sp_set_data_mode
function.

Remarks:

    In order to support multi-channel data, the manner of specifying
the waveform parameters has been simplified in SPHERE version 2.2.
Instead of extracting the information from the a variable number of
function arguments, the function now extracts the necessary
information from the SPHERE header.  Therefore, the function argument
list has changed from previous versions of SPHERE.  However, the
SPHERE 2.1 argument list is still supported for backward compatibility.
The 'size' argument although accepted, is now ignored.  Section VI,
"Linking to the SPHERE library" describes how to use either the 3 or 4
argument function call by using the C-define'd preprocessor variable
"SPHERE_PRE_2_2".

    If there is no 'sample_coding' field in the header, the default
operation is to read the data as PCM data.  The default behavior of
'sp_read_data()' can be modified by the function 'sp_set_data_mode()'
before 'sp_read_data()' is called.  If a checksum is present in
the header, the checksum is verified after reading the last 
block of data.

Return Value:

    The value returned by 'sp_read_data' indicates the number of
elements read in from the file.  If no elements are read, a zero is
returned.  Likewise, if an error or checksum verification error
occurs, a zero is returned.  The functions 'sp_eof()' and 'sp_error()'
may be used to determine if an error or an immediate end-of-file
caused the zero to be returned.

See Also:

    sp_eof(), sp_error(), sp_set_data_mode(), sp_data_alloc(),
    sp_data_free()


II.C.2 sp_write_data()

Description:
   
    Writes blocks of waveform data to an opened SPHERE file.

Syntax:

    /* New syntax for SPHERE version 2.2 or later              */
    int sp_write_data(void *ptr, size_t n, SP_FILE *sp_file)

    /* Syntax prior to SPHERE version 2.2, still supported for */
    /* backwards compatibility                                 */
    int sp_write_data(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t n, SP_FILE *sp_file)

Arguments:

    Appends 'n' elements to the end of the waveform data section of
the opened SPHERE file pointed to by 'sp_file'.  An element is defined
to be the sample values of all channels for a particular sample number
(common time point).  The function outputs the data in the form
specified by the mode string passed to 'sp_set_data_mode'.  By
default, the data is written with interleaved channels (if the data is
multi-channel data) and without further conversions.

   The 'ptr' argument can be either a linear array of interleaved
channel samples, or a 2-dimensional array of non-interleaved channel
samples, with each channel contained in a separate array.  The data is
written from an existing waveform data structure. 

   [ A waveform data structure is created by a call to the
'sp_data_alloc' function.  The form of the data structure is
determined by the mode string passed to the 'sp_set_data_mode'
function.  By default, the function expects the data to be structured
in a linear array.  To change the format to a multi-channel
2-dimensional array, use the sp_set_data_mode function. ]

Remarks:

    In order to support multi-channel data, the manner of specifying
the waveform parameters has been simplified in SPHERE version 2.2.
Instead of writing the data according to a variable number of function
arguments, the function now extracts the necessary information from a
SPHERE header constructed prior to the write.  Therefore, the function
argument list has changed from previous versions of SPHERE.  However,
the SPHERE 2.1 argument list is still supported for backward
compatibility.  The 'size' argument although accepted, is now ignored.
Section VI, "Linking to the SPHERE library" describes how to use
either the 3 or 4 argument function call by using the C-define'd
preprocessor variable "SPHERE_PRE_2_2".

    sp_write_data() uses the 'sample_coding', 'channel_count'
'sample_byte_format' and 'sample_n_bytes' fields of the header in the
'sp_file' structure to identify the format of the data in memory to
be written.  The default behavior is for the data to be written as
it is represented in memory (as specified by the above header fields).

    The default behavior of 'sp_write_data()' can be modified by the
function 'sp_set_data_mode()' before 'sp_write_data()' is called.
'sp_set_data_mode()' allows the programmer to specify waveform data
transformations as the data is written.

Return Value:

    The value returned by 'sp_write_data' indicates the number of
elements written to the file pointed to by the 'sp_file' structure.
Incomplete writes are not flagged by the function.  It is the
programmer's responsibility to make sure that the return value equals
'n'.

    sp_data_free()


II.C.3 sp_set_data_mode()

Description:
   
    Changes the default behavior of the SPHERE File I/O functions, 
'sp_read_data()' and 'sp_write_data()'.

Syntax:

    int sp_set_data_mode(SP_FILE *sp_file, char *mode)

Arguments:

    Specifies the waveform transformations for data read from, or
written to, the file pointed to by 'sp_file'.  The transformations are
specified in the string, 'mode'.  See the "Remarks" section for the
format and permissible values of this string.

Remarks:

    The 'mode' string argument specifies sample encoding and byte
order transformations to be performed by the SPHERE File I/O
functions, 'sp_read_data()' and 'sp_write_data()'.  (Future versions
may support sample rate transformations as well.) 

    When reading from a file via sp_read_data(), sp_set_data_mode()
sets the format of the data which is output from the sp_read function.

    When writing to a file via sp_write_data(), sp_set_data_mode()
sets the format of the data which is ultimately written to the file.
While the format of the data passed to sp_write_data() is controlled
by header field values for the fields: "sample_coding",
"channel_count", "sample_byte_format", and "sample_n_bytes", which
have been set by sp_h_set_field().

    The 'mode' string has the following format:


        MODE        :==  <MODE_FLAG> | <MODE_FLAG>:<MODE>
        MODE_FLAG   :==  SE-<SE_OPTIONS> | SBF-<SBF_OPTIONS> |
			 DF-<DF_OPTIONS> | CH-<CHANNEL_OPTIONS>
        SE_OPTIONS  :==  PCM | PCM-1 | PCM-2 | ULAW | RAW | ORIG |
                         SHORTEN | WAVPACK
	SBF_OPTIONS :==  01 | 10 | 1 | N | ORIG

Mode Flag and Option Descriptions:


    DF -> specifies the data structure of the buffer passed
	  into the functions 'sp_read_data()' and 'sp_write_data()'.  The
	  default format, "DF-RAW", specifies interleaved channels in a
	  1-dimensional array.

	DF_OPTIONS:
	    "RAW"     -> Data buffers are 1-dimensional arrays of contiguous
		 	 memory.  If multiple channels are present, they
			 are assumed to be interleaved.
	    "ARRAY"   -> Data buffers are 2-dimensional arrays (double 
			 pointers) where the data for each channel is in a
			 1-dimensional array of contiguous data.  The channel
			 number, starting at zero for the first channel, is
			 the first index in 2-dimensional array and the
			 sample number the second index.  See
			 'sp_data_alloc()' for a  description of the memory
			 layout.

	  The functions 'sp_data_alloc()' and 'sp_data_free()' allocate and 
	  deallocate data buffers in either format.

    CH -> specifies the channels to be read from a file, or written
	  to a file via the <CHANNEL_OPTIONS>.  If the file is being
	  read, the function 'sp_read_data()' returns the requested
	  channels from the input file.  If the files is being written
	  or updated, the library extracts the channels from the input
	  buffer before writing the samples to the file.  The default
	  operation (without channel selection), is to not perform any
	  modifications.

	  The <CHANNEL_OPTIONS> can select and re-order channels.  If the
	  sample type is pcm, pculaw or ulaw, the <CHANNEL_OPTIONS> can 
	  sum two or more channels together.

	  The <CHANNEL_OPTIONS> format is a comma separated list of 
	  channel identifiers.  The channel identifiers start at 1 
	  for the first channel.  The <CHANNEL_OPTIONS> are of the
	  following format:

	CHANNEL_OPTIONS :== <CHANNEL_ID> | <CHANNEL_ID>,<CHANNEL_OPTIONS>
	CHANNEL_ID      :== <CHANNEL_NUMBER> | <CHANNEL_NUMBER>+<CHANNEL_ID>
	CHANNEL_NUMBER  :== the channel number, starting with 1 for
	 		    the first channel.
	  
		   	 
    SE -> specifies a transformation to the encoding of the sampled
	  waveform data.

        SE_OPTIONS:

            "PCM-2"   -> Read or write data as 2-byte PCM samples.
            "PCM-1"   -> Read or write data as 1-byte PCM samples.
            "PCM"     -> Synonym for "PCM-2"
            "ULAW"    -> Read or write data as 1-byte ULAW samples.
  	    "RAW"     -> Read or write data as 1-byte character
	                 stream (for unsupported data types).
            "ORIG"    -> Read or write data as-is.
	    "SHORTEN" -> Write data as Shorten-compressed byte stream.
	    "WAVPACK" -> Write data as Wavpack-compressed byte stream.
    
    SBF -> specifies a transformation to the byte format (byte order)
	   of the sampled waveform data.  This is only appropriate for
           multi-byte sampled data.

        SBF_OPTIONS:

II.C.4 sp_rewind()

Description:
   
    Rewind to the beginning of a SPHERE waveform if the file was
opened for reading.

Syntax:

    int sp_rewind(SP_FILE *sp_file)

Arguments:

    Rewind to the beginning of a waveform if the SPHERE file,
'sp_file', was opened for reading.  

Remarks:

    If the data mode was changed via 'sp_set_data_mode()', the changes
are in effect until subsequent calls to 'sp_set_data_mode()' are made.

    Using the rewind function is more efficient than closing the file
using 'sp_close()' and then re-opening the file using 'sp_open()'.
Overhead is saved by not re-parsing the SPHERE header and not
re-decompressing a compressed waveform.

    This function is unable to rewind SPHERE files which are read from
stdin.

    Although this function could be written solely with sp_seek(),
using this function resets the SPHERE file so that sp_set_data_mode()
can be called again on the file.

Return Value:

    The value returned by 'sp_rewind()' is 0 if the operation was
successful and greater than 100 on error.

See Also:

    sp_set_data_mode(), sp_read_data(), sp_open(), sp_close()


II.C.5 sp_seek()

Description:
   
    Perform a 'seek' operation to a specific sample of opened SPHERE
waveform which has been opened for read.

Syntax:

    int sp_seek(SP_FILE *sp_file, int offset, int origin)

Arguments:

    Move the SPHERE file pointer 'sp_file' to the sample defined by
'offset' and 'origin'.  The SPHERE waveform file must be opened for
read.

Remarks:

    Sp_seek() takes the opened-for-read SPHERE file and moves the file
pointer to the sample defined by the 'offset' and 'origin' arguments.

    The 'offset' and 'origin' arguments specify the sample position at
which the next read will occur.  Offset must be an integer (which may
be negative) and origin must be one of the following:
 
     0    The new access position will be offset samples from  the
          start of the file.
 
     1    The new access position will be offset samples from  the
          current  access  position;  a negative offset moves the
          access position backwards in the file.
 
     2    The new access position will be offset samples from  the
          end  of  the file.  A negative offset places the access
          position before the end-of-file, and a positive  offset
          is illegal.

    For multi-channel interleaved data, the file pointer is moved to
the nth sample of all channels.

    If the opened SPHERE file is a pipe, then the seek can only go
forward in the file.  In this case, the seek is performed via
sequential reads to the appropriate location.

    When sp_seek() is called, checksum computation and verification
are disabled unless the file is seek'd to sample 0 in which case
the sample checksum computations are reset.

Return Value:

    If an error occurs, 1 is return.  Otherwise 0 is returned.

See Also:

    sp_set_data_mode(), sp_read_data(), sp_open(), sp_close()


II.C.6 sp_tell()

Description:
   
    Return the waveform sample position at which the next read or
write to a SPHERE file will occur.

Syntax:

    int sp_tell(SP_FILE *sp_file)

Arguments:

    Return the sample position in 'sp_file' at which the next read or
write will occur.

Remarks:

    Sp_tell() works for SPHERE files opened for read or write access
only.

    For multi-channel interleaved data, the value returned is
the nth sample of all channels.

Return Value:

    If an error occurs, -1 is return.  Otherwise the sample number is
returned.

See Also:

    sp_read_data(), sp_write_data(), sp_open(), sp_close()

II.C.6 sp_compute_checksum()

Description:
   
    Compute and return the checksum for a SPHERE file opened for read.

Syntax:

    int sp_compute_checksum(SP_FILE *sp_file, SP_CHECKSUM *checksum)

Arguments:

    Compute a checksum for the SPHERE file 'sp_file' which has been
opened for read and return the checksum in the pointer '*checksum'.

Remarks:

    Sp_compute_checksum() first calls sp_tell() to save the current
sample pointed to by the SP_FILE pointer.  Then an sp_seek() to the
0th sample of the SPHERE file is performed and the entire waveform is
read in to compute the checksum.  After the checksum is calculated,
another sp_seek() is performed to return the SP_FILE to it's original
sample position.

Return Value:

    Successful execution returns a 0, otherwise a number greater than 
100 is returned.

See Also:

    sp_tell(), sp_seek(), sp_open(), sp_close()


II.D   Status Functions

II.D.1 sp_eof()

Description:

    Returns the End-of-File (EOF) status of an opened SPHERE file.

Syntax:

    int sp_eof(SP_FILE *sp_file)
	
Arguments:

    sp_eof takes as it's argument a SPHERE file pointer, 'sp_file',
and returns the EOF status of that file.

Return Value:

    sp_eof returns a non-zero value if the end-of-file has been
reached during the last file read.  Otherwise, it returns a zero.

See Also:
    sp_read_data(), sp_error()


II.D.2 sp_error()

Description:

    Returns the error status of an opened SPHERE file.

Syntax:

    int sp_error(SP_FILE *sp_file)
	
Arguments:

    sp_error takes as it's argument a SPHERE file pointer, 'sp_file',
and returns the error status of that file.

Return Value:

    sp_error returns a zero if no errors occurred during the last file
I/O operation, a 100 if a checksum verification error occurred, or greater
than 100 if a fatal file I/O error occurred.

See Also:
    sp_read_data(), sp_write_data(), sp_eof()


II.D.3 sp_print_return_status()

Description:

    Prints the return status of the last SPHERE function call.

Syntax:

    int sp_print_return_status(FILE *fp)

Arguments:
    
    sp_return_status takes as it's argument an opened file pointer,
'fp', and prints a message indicating the success or failure and
library version number of the last SPHERE function called to 'fp'.

Remarks:

    sp_return_status prints the following report for the last
function called:

    Procedure: <function-name> V2.4
        Status code: <integer-value>
        Status type: <Success|Warning|Error>
        Message: <message-string>

Failures of child functions are recorded in the Message string.

Note: This is currently only defined for the SPHERE 2.0 C-language
Programmer Interface Library functions.

Return Value:
    
    sp_return_status a zero on success and a 100 or greater on error.


II.D.4 sp_return_status()

Description:

    Returns the return status of the last SPHERE function call.

Syntax:

    int sp_return_status()

Return Value:
    
    sp_return_status returns the status of the last SPHERE function
call.  The SPHERE 2.0 C-Language Programmers Interface Library functions
follow the conventions below for indicating Success, Warnings, or
Errors:

     	Return Condition	Possible Range of Values
	---------------- 	------------------------
	   Success		           0
	   Warning                        1-99
	   Fatal Error	             100 or greater

Note: This is currently only defined for the SPHERE 2.0 C-language
Programmer Interface Library functions.

II.D.5  sp_get_version()

Description:

    Returns a pointer to a character string that identifies the SPHERE
library version.

Syntax:

    char *sp_get_version(void)

Return Value:
    
    sp_get_version returns a pointer to a character string that
defines the SPHERE Library version.  An example of the string would
be: "SPHERE Lib V2.4".


Note: The character string should NOT by "free()'d" by the programmer.


II.E   Data (Waveform) Buffer Allocation/Deallocation Functions

II.E.1 sp_data_alloc()

Description:

    Return a pointer to memory allocated for N samples of all data
channels for an opened SP_FILE.

Syntax:

    void *sp_data_alloc(SP_FILE *sp, int nsamp)
	
Arguments:

sp_data_alloc takes as it's argument a SP_FILE pointer, 'sp', and the
number of samples 'nsamp' and returns an allocated buffer large enough
to hold 'nsamp' samples times the number of channels.  If the SP_FILE
pointer is opened for read and 'nsamp' is -1, the returned buffer will
be size of the entire file.  If the SP_FILE is opened for write, and
'nsamp' is -1, an error will occur.

Remarks:

   The returned buffer can be either a linear array of interleaved
channel samples, or a 2-dimensional array of non-interleaved channel
samples, with each channel contained in a separate array.  The form of
the data structure is determined by the mode string passed to the
'sp_set_data_mode' function.

If 'nsamp' is greater than 0, and if a linear array
(interleaved channels) is specified in the mode string, the buffer
byte size is computed as follows:

	sample_n_bytes * channel_count * nsamp

	The sample_n_bytes and channel_count values are obtained from
	the SP_FILE's header.    

If 'nsamp' is greater than zero and a 2-dimensional array is specified
in the mode string, then the memory structure below is created and
returned.  The SP_FILE's sample_n_bytes and channel_count fields are
used to create a structure large enough to hold the data.

The structure consists of an array of double pointers for each
channel, and each double pointer points to an array of 'nsamp'
samples.

                	 <--- 'nsamp' samples --->    
		___      _________________________
     	^	| |  ->  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
        |	| |	 -------------------------
     	|	|-|      _________________________
     channel	| |  ->  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
      count	| |	 -------------------------
	|	|-|      _________________________
	|	| |  ->  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
	|	| |	 -------------------------
	v	---

The programmer must 'cast' the returned pointer to a double pointer of
the expected type.  The programmer has a choice to access the data in
two ways: 

	1. as a 2-dimensional array where the first subscript is the
	   channel (zero for the first channel), and the second
	   subscript is the sample number, e.g. arr[0][40].

	2. as a pointer to each channel's data, e.g. arr[0], arr[1] ...

If the defaults are not to be used, sp_set_data_mode must be called
before sp_data_alloc.  Further calls to sp_set_data_mode after the
structure is created can result in unknown spurious errors.

Return Value:

    sp_data_alloc() returns a pointer to memory allocated for waveform
data.  The returned value must be 'cast' to the programmer's expected
data type.  If an error occurs, a NULL is returned.

See Also:
    sp_read_data(), sp_write_data(), sp_set_data_mode(), sp_data_free()

I.E.2 sp_data_free()

Description:

    Frees a memory structure created by a call to sp_data_alloc().

Syntax:

    int sp_data_free(SP_FILE *sp, void *buffer)
	
Arguments:

    sp_data_free takes as it's argument a SPHERE file pointer, 'sp',
and a pointer to a memory buffer created by a call to sp_data_alloc()
and "frees" the memory associated with the buffer.

Remarks:

   The buffer can be either a linear array of interleaved channel
samples, or a 2-dimensional array of non-interleaved channel samples,
with each channel contained in a separate array.  The form of the data
structure is determined by the mode string passed to the
'sp_set_data_mode' function.

Return Value:

    sp_data_free() returns a zero on success, and 100 or greater
on error.

See Also:
    sp_read_data(), sp_write_data(), sp_set_data_mode(), sp_data_alloc()


III.  File Format Definition

SPHERE files contain a strictly defined header portion followed by
the file body (waveform).  Any waveform encoding may be used, but the
encoding must be sufficiently described in the header.

The header is an object-oriented, 1024-byte blocked, ASCII structure
which is prepended to the waveform data.  The header is composed of a
fixed-format portion followed by an object-oriented variable portion.
The fixed portion is as follows:

NIST_1A<new-line>
   1024<new-line>

The first line specifies the header type and the second line specifies the
header length.  Each of these lines are 8 bytes long (including new-line) and
are structured to identify the header as well as allow those who do not wish
to read the subsequent header information to programmatically skip over it. 

The remaining object-oriented variable portion is composed of
object-type-value "triple" lines which have the following format:


<LINE> --> <TRIPLE><new-line> |
           <COMMENT><new-line> | 
           <TRIPLE><COMMENT><new-line> | 

  <TRIPLE> --> <OBJECT><space><TYPE><space><VALUE><OPT-SPACES>

    <OBJECT> --> <PRIMARY-SUBOBJECT> | 
                 <PRIMARY-SUBOBJECT><SECONDARY-SUBOBJECT>

    <PRIMARY-SUBOBJECT> --> <ALPHA> | <ALPHA><ALPHA-NUM-STRING>
    <SECONDARY-SUBOBJECT> --> _<ALPHA-NUM-STRING> | 
                              _<ALPHA-NUM-STRING><SECONDARY-SUBOBJECT>

    <TYPE> --> -<INTEGER-FLAG> | -<REAL-FLAG> | -<STRING-FLAG>

      <INTEGER-FLAG> --> i
      <REAL-FLAG> --> r
      <STRING-FLAG> --> s<DIGIT-STRING>
      
    <VALUE> --> <INTEGER> | <REAL> | <STRING>  (depending on object type)

      <INTEGER> --> <SIGN><DIGIT-STRING>
      <REAL> --> <SIGN><DIGIT-STRING>.<DIGIT-STRING> 

    <OPT-SPACES> --> <SPACES> | NULL

  <COMMENT> --> ;<STRING>  (excluding embedded new-lines)

<ALPHA-NUM-STRING> --> <ALPHA-NUM> | <ALPHA-NUM><ALPHA-NUM-STRING>
<ALPHA-NUM> --> <DIGIT> | <ALPHA>
<ALPHA> --> a | ... | z | A | ... | Z
<DIGIT-STRING> --> <DIGIT> | <DIGIT><DIGIT-STRING>
<DIGIT> --> 0 | ... | 9
<SIGN> --> + | - | NULL
<SPACES> --> <space> | <SPACES><space>
<STRING> -->  <CHARACTER> | <CHARACTER><STRING>
<CHARACTER> --> char(0) | char(1) | ... | char(255)

The following fields are required for proper SPHERE I/O handling.
These fields completely describe the geometry of the data contained in
the SPHERE file.

        Field_name         Field_type
	----------         ----------
	sample_count           -i      (Defined to be the number of samples
					per channel)
	sample_n_bytes         -i
	channel_count          -i

The following fields are optional:

        Field_name         Field_type
	----------         ----------
	sample_checksum        -i       
        sample_coding          -s       (If missing, defaults to 'pcm')
        sample_byte_format     -s       (If missing, defaults to the Host's
                                         natural byte format.)

The following fields are conditionally required:

        Field_name         Field_type   Required if:
	----------         ----------   ------------
	sample_rate            -i       (the 'sample_coding' field is
					 missing, or contains 'pcm' or 'ulaw')

Possible values for these fields are:

	sample_count -> 1 .. MAXINT
	sample_n_bytes -> 1 | 2
	channel_count -> 1 .. 32
	sample_byte_format -> 01 | 10 | 1 (* See below for exception)
	sample_checksum -> 0 .. 32767
	sample_rate -> 1 .. MAXINT
	sample_coding -> pcm | ulaw | pcm,embedded-shorten-vX.X | 
			 ulaw,embedded-shorten-vX.X |
			 pcm,embedded-wavpack-X.X | 
			 ulaw,embedded-wavpack-X.X |
			 pcm,embedded-shortpack-X.X (Read Only)

	* Note: The original recordable CD-ROM release of WSJ0 incorporated
	        "shortpack" waveform compression.  The compression was 
		indicated by the now outmoded presence of the string,
		'shortpack-v0',	in the 'sample_byte_format' field.
		Since this software attempts to support all previous
		NIST releases of speech corpora, this "non-standard"
		field value is permitted.  Please note that this
		software will not generate files with this field value
		and that the LDC is producing a CD-ROM release of WSJ0
		which conforms to the specifications defined in SPHERE 2.0.

The single object "end_head" marks the end of the active header and the
remaining unused header space is undefined. A sample header is included
below.

IV.  File Pointer Structure

The following is a description of the file pointer structure used by
SPHERE to address opened files.

The structure includes pointers to the parsed header, the waveform,
and a structure used by SPHERE to track the status of various
operations on the opened file.

NOTE:   The SPHERE file pointer structure has been designed to be used
	exclusively by the SPHERE library functions.  The programmer
	should only include the structure in argument lists passed to
	SPHERE function calls.  The programmer should NOT attempt to
	manipulate this structure directly.


    SPHERE Structure 'SP_FILE' 

	typedef struct sphere_t SP_FILE;

	struct sphere_t {
       		struct header_t *header;
                struct waveform_t *waveform;
		struct spfile_status_t *status;
	};

        struct waveform_t {
	        /* This structure is intended for use only by */
		/* the SPHERE-library functions               */
        };

        struct spfile_status_t {
	        /* This structure is intended for use only by */
		/* the SPHERE-library functions               */
	};

	struct header_t {
	        /* This structure is intended for use only by */
		/* the SPHERE-library functions               */
	};



V.  Installation

To install SPHERE on a Unix system, cd into the 'nist' directory of
the SPHERE distribution hierarchy and type the command:

	sh src/scripts/install

The SPHERE libraries will be created and placed in the 'lib'
directory, and the sample programs, described in the 'System-Level
Utilities' section, will be compiled and placed in the 'bin'
directory.  Installation on non-Unix systems without "make" and "sh"
will probably require manual compilation.  The next release of SPHERE
will support compilation of SPHERE on PC's.

Included with this release is a functional interface test program
which exercises various header manipulation and waveform
compression/decompression functions.  To run the test, execute the
command from the 'nist' directory in the distribution hierarchy:

	tsphere -d lib/data

The program requires the files in the 'lib/data' directory of the
SPHERE distribution hierarchy.  If all is well, the program will run
without errors.  If an error occurs, send a bug report as specified in
the 'Bug Reports' section.



VI.  Linking to the SPHERE library

User programs are linked with two object code libraries:

	libsp.a       - user level SPHERE functions
			include compression code
	libutil.a     - SPHERE-internal functions

Both libraries must be 'linked' for successful use of SPHERE.
During the installation process, the source code for these
libraries is placed in the 'lib' directory of the distribution
hierarchy.   

User programs must include the following line in order to link
with the SPHERE libraries:

	#include <sp/sphere.h>

This include file references all of the required library files.

If the user's programs were written using a SPHERE version 2.0 beta 1
to SPHERE version 2.1, the new syntax for sp_read_data and
sp_write_data needs to be taken into consideration, (see Section II
for function descriptions).  There are two ways to use the old code,
either change the code to conform to the new syntax, or do not
re-write the code, but set a pre-processor variable, "SPHERE_PRE_2_2".
The pre-processor variable can be set in two locations, the choice
of location depends on the choice of the programmer. 

	1. The first location is in each source file which includes
	   the "sp/sphere.h" file.  Before the include statement for
	   "sp/sphere.h", put in the define statement
	   "#define SPHERE_PRE_2_2".  This allows flexibility for each
	   source code file.

	2. The second location is in the "sp/sphere.h" file itself.
	   Simply uncomment the define for "SPHERE_PRE_2_2" on line 36.
	   Now every program which includes "sp/sphere.h" must use
	   the old syntax of sp_read_data and sp_write_data.

In either case, the include file will then properly handle all
references to sp_read_data and sp_write_data.

To compile a program, such as the command-line SPHERE utility,
'w_decode', which is found in the 'src/prog' directory, execute
the following command:

	cc -L<INSTALL_DIR>/nist/lib -I<INSTALL_DIR>/nist/include \
		-o w_decode w_decode.c -lsp -lutil -lm

        where "INSTALL_DIR" is the directory where the SPHERE library
        source code is located.

If an unresolvable error occurs in compiling a program which uses the
SPHERE library, you may send a bug report as specified in the 'Bug
Reports' section and someone will assist you.



VII.  Example Interface Library Usage

Example 1: To load the embedded shorten-compressed 2-byte-per-sample
PCM file, "file.wav", into memory in its uncompressed form.  This version
uses the SPHERE 2.2 and later function call to sp_read_data.

    SP_FILE *sp;
    short *waveform;
    SP_INTEGER sample_count;
    int wave_byte_size, total_samples;

    if ((sp = sp_open("file.wav","r")) == (SP_FILE *)0) {
        fprintf(stderr,"Error: Unable to open SPHERE file %s\n","file.wav");
        return(-1);
    }

    if (sp_h_get_field(sp,"sample_count",T_INTEGER,&sample_count) > 0)
	return(-1);

    if ((waveform=(short *)sp_data_alloc(-1)) == (short *)0){
        fprintf(stderr,"Error: Unable to allocate waveform memory\n");

VIII.  System-Level Utilities

    The following are command-line utilities which have been created using
    the SPHERE libraries.  These programs provide the ability to read,
    write, and modify SPHERE headers and to compress/decompress
    SPHERE-headered waveforms.

    h_read [options] [file ...]
        reads headers from the files listed on the command line; by default,
	output is lines of tuples consisting of all fieldnames and values;
	many options modify the program's behavior; see the manual page
	"h_read.1";

    h_add [-vh] inputfile outputfile
        adds an empty header to the "raw" unheadered speech samples in
	inputfile and stores the result in outputfile;

    h_strip inputfile outputfile
        strips the SPHERE header from inputfile, stores the remaining data in
	outputfile; if outputfile is "-", writes the sample data to "stdout";

    h_edit [-uf] [-D dir] -opchar fieldname=value -K fieldname ... file ...
    h_edit [-uf] [-o outfile] -opchar fieldname=value -K fieldname ... file
        edit specified header fields in the specified file(s).  In the first
	form, it either modifies the file(s) in place or copies them to the
	specified directory "dir".  In the second form, it either modifies
	the file in place or copies it to the specified file "outfile".

        The "-u" option causes the original files to be unlinked (deleted)
	after modification.  The "-f" option forces the program to continue
	after reporting any errors.

        The "opchar" must be either "S","I", or "R" to denote string,
	integer, or real field types respectively.  

|	The opchar, "K", can be used to delete, or (K)ill, the field.
	

    h_delete [-uf] [-D dir] -F fieldname ... file ...
    h_delete [-uf] [-o outfile] -F fieldname ... file
        delete specified header fields in the specified file(s). In the first
	form, it either modifies the file(s) in place or copies them to the
	specified directory "dir".

        In the second form, it either modifies the file in place or copies it
	to the specified file "outfile".

        The "-u" option causes the original files to be unlinked (deleted)
	after modification.  The "-f" option forces the program to continue
	after reporting any errors.

    w_encode [-mvf] -t [ wavpack | shorten | ulaw ]  file_in file_out
    w_encode [-mvi] -t [ wavpack | shorten | ulaw ]  file1 file2 . . . 
        Encode the file as the type defined by the "-t" option.  The program
	will use the header information to optimize the compression scheme.
	The default operation is to encode the file specified in
	"file_in" and place the contents into the file specified in
	"file_out".  If the filenames specified in "file_in" or "file_out"
	are "-", then stdin and stdout are used respectively.  In addition,
	an error will be generated if "file_out" already exists. The "-f"
	option causes an existing "file_out" to be overwritten.

        The waveform I/O routines automatically convert the byte order of a
	file to the host machine's natural format.  The "-m" option forces
	the encoding to maintain the original byte order of "file_in".

        The "-i" option forces w_encode to replace the input file with it's
	encoded version.  When this "in place" option is used, the header is
	modified to indicate the new encoding as well.  This option also
	allows more than one input file to be specified on the command line.

        The "-v" option gives verbose output.

    w_decode [-vf] [ -o OUTTYPE ] file_in file_out
    w_decode [-vi] [ -o OUTTYPE ] file1 file2 . . . 
	Where:
		OUTTYPE = short_10 | pcm_10 | 
			  short_01 | pcm_01 |
			  short_natural | pcm |
			  ulaw 

        Decode the input file into the output format specified by "-o".  If
	the file is already encoded as specified, no action is taken.  The 
	qualifiers "_10" and "_01" on the output types "short" and "pcm" 
	stand for byte orders MSB/LSB and LSB/MSB respectively.  The output
	types "pcm" and "short_natural" forces the byte order to be
	converted if necessary to the local machine's natural byte order.

        w_decode reads the header and sample data and performs conversions on
	the output as necessary.  The default operation is to decode the file
	specified in "file_in" and place the contents into the file specified
	in "file_out".  If the filenames specified in "file_in" or "file_out"
	are "-", then stdin and stdout are used respectively.  In addition,
	an error will be generated if "file_out" already exists.  The "-f"
	option causes an existing "file_out" to be overwritten.

        The "-i" option forces w_encode to replace the input file with it's
	encoded version.  When this "in place" option is used, the header is
	modified to indicate the new encoding as well.  This option also
	allows more than one input file to be specified on the command line.

        The "-v" option gives verbose output.

    w_edit [-vf] -o [-[t|p]F:T]] [-oOUT ] { filein | - } { fileout | - }

        W_edit is a  waveform  editing  command  to  manipulate  and
        extract  samples  the  waveform  data in a sphere file.  The
        following functions can be performed on a file:


        -tF:T   Set the range for output from time  F  (seconds)  to
                time  T.  If F is missing, it defaults to the begin-
                ing of the file, if T is missing, go to the end  of
                the file.

        -sF:T   Set the range for output from F samples  to  T  sam-
                ples.  If F is missing, it defaults to the beginning
                of the file, if T is missing, go to the end  of  the
                file.

        -cEXP   Extract only the samples from channels in EXP.   The
                expression  will  also  add channels together if the
                '+' is used.

        -oOUT   Set the output format to the following formats:

                ulaw
                   output the samples as ulaw encoding.

                pcm_01 | short_01
                   output  the  samples  as   PCM   values   in   01
                   sample_byte_format

                pcm_10 | short_10
                   output  the  samples  as   PCM   values   in   10
                   sample_byte_format
 
                pcm | short_natural
                   output the samples as PCM  values  in  the  cpu's
                   natural byte format

        -v      option gives verbose output.

	If the file size has been changed by either the '-t' or '-s' option,
	the program adds (or modifies) three header fields to describe 
	the origins of the data.  Two "REAL" type header fields, 'start_time'
	and 'end_time', are added to store the begin and end times of the
	new file in relation to the original file.  The third field, 
	'data_origins', is added to identify original file.  The field
	contains a comma separated list of fields from the original file
	including, "database_id", "database_version" (if present), and
	either "conversation_id", "utterance_id", or by default 'file1' from
	the command line.

     w_diff w_diff [-hvdws] [-cCSTR] file1 file2

        W_diff is a waveform comparing program.  It can compare  the
        SPHERE  headers of two files as well as the data portions of
        two SPHERE files.  If the files do not  differ,  a  zero  is
        returned  by  the  program,  otherwise  a  non-zero value is
        returned.


        -cCSTR  Convert the files by the 'CSTR' used in  a  call  to
                sp_set_data_mode()

        -d      Compare the data portions of the files byte by byte.
  
        -h      Print this help message.

        -s      Compare the SPHERE headers of the files.

        -w      Compare the waveforms of the two  files  after  con-
                verting  them using the conversion string in 'CSTR'.
                This is the default

        -v      Set the verbosity level up by one, repeat the v  for
                higher  levels.   A verbosity setting of 1 will pro-
                vide a description of each tests outcome.


IX.  Revision History

Changes in Release 1.5:

	1. New functions were added to the Sphere library:
		sp_get_fieldnames()
		sp_get_type()
		sp_get_size()
		sp_is_std()

		(see the sphere library man page for descriptions)

	2. h_read: command line options were changed

	3. h_strip: writes to stdout if destination is "-"

	4. man page for h_read


Changes in Release 1.6:

	1. Utilities that use h_modify.c are now much faster in
		most cases when editing in-place -- if the size
		of the header does not change, the new header is
		copied over the old one.

	2. Modified sp_write_header() to work when writing to
		objects other than files. The function ftell()
		was previously used directly on the output
		stream to ascertain the number of bytes
		in the header; now the header is written
		to a temp file to ascertain the header size,
		then to the output stream.

	3. Modified to sp_open_header() and spx_read_header()
		to no longer test if the input file is at
		position 0. This will allow reading from
		pipes, etc.

	4. h_add: can read from stdin and/or write to stdout;
		no longer puts any dummy fields in the header.

	5. h_strip: can now read from stdin in addition to
		writing to stdout.

	6. Added h_header and raw2nist to the Sphere package.
		They are Bourne shell scripts (/bin/sh) to,
		respectively, print file headers and convert raw
		data (no header) to Sphere format.

	7. Manual pages for commands h_edit, h_delete, h_add,
		h_strip and raw2nist

Changes in Release 1.7:

	1. h_read: added "-C field" option to check that the
		specified field(s) is in the headers of all files
		on the command line.

Changes in Release 2.0 Beta:

	1. SPHERE now has a new functional interface to waveform data
		and headers.  The unified approach is detailed in the
                "C-Language Programmer Interface Library" section.

	2. Library libsp.a won't be removed if "make" is interrupted.

	3. Using ANSI functions instead of BSD equivalents:
		index() -> strchr()
		rindex() -> strrchr()
		bcopy() -> memcpy()
		bzero() -> memset()

	4. Include file changes:
		<stdlib.h>: rand(), malloc(), realloc(), etc.
		<string.h>: replaces <strings.h>
		<errno.h>: errno
		"getopt.h": getopt(), optind, optarg

	5. The function getopt() is now expected to return -1
		when there are no more command line arguments
		to be parsed. Previously, it was expected  to
		return EOF.  resetopt() clears the history state
		of getopt() to enable re-using getopt().

	6. New programs "w_encode" and "w_decode" allow sampled
                waveform data to be compressed (w_encode) or
                decompressed (w_decode) using either the "wavpack" or
                "shorten" algorithms.

	7. Waveform encoding functions added including a set
                to allow data to be compressed using the "wavpack" or
		"shorten" algorithms with input and/or output
		data coming from memory or a file pointer, and
		a set of analogous functions for decompression.
	
Changes in Release 2.0 Beta 2:

	1. Corrected Known Software Bugs:
		a. The function 'set_data_mode' should have been named 
		   'sp_set_data_mode'.
		b. Waveforms without checksums are now readable.
		c. the installation process was updated.

	2. Function Changes:
		a. The function 'sp_return_status' was renamed to 
		   'sp_print_return_status'.
		b. A new function was written 'sp_get_return_status'
		   which allows the programmer to retrieve the return
		   status of the last function call.		   

	3. Merged the libraries to simplify the linking procedures.
		- see the Linking to the SPHERE library Section of the
		  SPHERE Manual

	4. Re-designation of required header fields.
		- see the File Format Definition Section of the
		  SPHERE Manual

	5. Decompression will use a temporary file if the waveform size
	   is larger the a specified byte size.  (Details of modifying the
	   variable will be added to the installation script in a future
	   release.)

	6. Addition of 'shortpack' decompression to facilitate reading
	   of the WSJ0 Write-Once CD-ROMS.


Changes in Release 2.0 Beta 2.1:
	
	1. Corrected an unclosed file pointer problem which was activated
	   when uncompressing files.


Changes in Release 2.1:
 
        1. Corrected an improperly defined variable in sphio.c.
 
	2. Create the following new command line utilities:
		tsphere


Changes in Release 2.2:
	
	1. Added the ability to read and write ulaw data files.  This 
	   includes the following new abilities:
		a. Compute and verify a checksum for the one-byte 
		   sample data using the same algorithm but using
		   one byte data.
		b. Add the capability to read/write ulaw data as ulaw
		   or converted to 2-byte PCM data.  If the sample
		   type changes, a new checksum is computed.

	2. Added support for stereo (multi-channel) data files which
	   includes the following abilities:
		a. Added the ability to selectively read channels from a 
		   multi-channel file.
		b. Added the ability to add channels together for PCM
	 	   and ulaw data.
	   
	3. Changed the syntax for the sp_read_data and sp_write_data
	   functions.

	4. Created the following new library functions:
		sp_copy_header()
		sp_data_free()
		sp_data_alloc()

	5. Create the following new command line utilities:
		w_diff
		w_edit

	6. Added typedef's for the header values:
	  	SP_STRING, SP_INTEGER, SP_REAL
	
	7. Added setjmp to allow compression packages to return error
	   coded rather than aborting execution.	   

	8. All library messages now print to stderr.
	
	9. Update to tsphere to test new capabilties.
		a. Added Document Example 2 to the Tests.

	10. Converted the source code to be ANSI C Compliant.

	11. Added synonyms for the 'short', 'short_10' and 'short_01'
	   options to w_decode. 

	12. Made the default waveform format of a written file to
	   be 2-byte pcm data.  This correct a problem with missing
	   'sample_coding' fields in written files.

	13. Added a new library function, correct_out_of_date_headers(),
	   to handle out-of-date headers.  Currently, the function 
	   correct the incorrect sample count header field of Switchboard
	   files.

	14. Added a new library function, sp_compute_char_checksum()
	    to compute a 2-byte checksum one byte data.

	15. Fixed a bug in h_read's verify option '-V' when used on
	    multi-channel data.


Changes in Release 2.3:

	1. Repaired Non-ANSIism reported by Charles Hemphill.
		a. Removed the use of bcopy in favor of memcpy (everywhere).
		b. Added the include of "string.h" into
		   'src/lib/util/string.c', 'src/bin/tsphere.c',
		   'src/lib/sp/nat_bord.c', 'src/lib/util/hsgetopt.c',
		   'src/lib/sp/dif_wavf.c'
		c. Removed the use of index() in favor of strchr (everywhere).
		   'src/lib/sp/sdatamod.c'
		d. Added code to allow the use of 'ntohl()' and 'htons()'
	 	   in the shortpack library.

	2. Fixed a problem in the Shortpack library.  The function
	   getw() was used instead of fob_getw().

	3. Removed prototypes for function prototype in shorten.h.

	4. Changed the function prototypes for strlen and strcmp in
	   'hs_getops.c'.

	5. Improved SPHERE's ability to be used with pipe-based software.
	   This makes an exception for a missing 'sample_count' field
	   if the SPHERE file was opened for stdin or stdout.

	6. Corrected some errors in 'src/lib/dif_wav.c'.


Changes in Release 2.4:

	1. Corrected a return message for 'sp_set_data_mode()' error
	   code 128.
	
	2. Added a fourth example to the documentation and to 'tsphere'.
	   The example creates a SPHERE headered signal file.

	3. Corrected an error in spoutput.c, proceedure sp_write_header().
	   The temporary files where not being deleted properly. 

	4. Repaired an error in sp_write_header() that was only activated
	   on specific platforms.  The code used sprintf to create a
	   fixed portion of the sphere header and on some machines, sprintf
	   writes extra data after the end of the string.

	5. Fixed problems in sp_write_data() and sp_read_data() where
	   the functions were converting sample codings from PCM to ULAW
	   and when summing ULAW channels together.

	6. Fixed a conditional printing statement in h_modify.c in the
	   src/bin/h_edit and src/bin/h_delete directories.


Changes in Release 2.5:
	
	1: Added a function to retrieve the version information of the SPHERE
	   library, "sp_get_version()".

	2: Added the capability print the version number of the SPHERE
	   library linked to during compilation.  In addition, all command-
	   line programs print the SPHERE library version number when the
	   '-v' option is used.  The function 'sp_print_return_status()' 
	   prints the version number of the SPHERE library.

	3: Changed the command line arguments for "h_add" to include "-v"
	   and "-h".

	4: Update the installation scripts to be compatible with the
	   DEC Alpha and HP UNIX operating systems.

	5: Changed the use of bcmp() to memcmp() in tsphere.h and dif_wavf.c
	   to be ANSI compliant.

	6: Solaris does not like '(char *)0' passed for a string to printf.
	   Had to change the tsphere.c to use "" for an empty character 
	   string.

	7: Removed h_nlrm from the distribution.  This was a non-documented
	   program with limited usefulness.

	8: Added the ability to delete fields from the h_edit command line
	   utility via the 'K' option.


Changes in Release 2.6:

	1: Added the functions 'sp_rewind()', 'sp_tell()', 'sp_seek()'
	   and 'sp_compute_checksum()'.
	
	2: Added code to 'w_edit' to store the name of a source file
	   when a derived file is created.  Also stores the start and end 
	   times for a derived wrt. the original file.
	   - Increased 'w_edit's' efficiency by using 'sp_seek()' rather that
	     sequential reads.
	   - Improved error condition handling in 'w_edit'.

	3: Changed 'h_add' to use blocked I/O instead of character I/O to
	   improve performance.

	4: Created versions of 'ntohl' and 'htons' within SPHERE to support
	   cross-platform portablity of 'shortpack'.

	5: Added support for bit-reverse ulaw, a format frequently used
	   in digital telephony hardware.

	6: Updated support of Shorten within SPHERE to version 2.0.

	7: Updated 'tsphere.c' to test additional functionality added
	   in this release.

	8: Added support for using the argument "SE-ORIG" in a call to
	   sp_set_data_mode() when the file is compressed.  This allows
	   access to the value of the 'sample_coding' of the SPHERE file
	   as stored on disk  (before any automatic decompression is 
	   used).

	   If the file on disk is compressd, sp_set_data_mode() returns the
	   warning stating "reads can not be performed on a compressed file".
	   Fixes supplied by J.Thompson@swansea.ac.uk.

	9. Added #ifndef's to all include files so as to never include a
	   file's contents more than once.

	10. Modified SPHERE library structure 
	    sp->write_spifr->waveform->header_data_len to contain the
	    SPHERE header size rather than the data size.

	11. Added elements to the SP_FILE structure.  This will neccessitate
	    all local C code which uses the structure to be re-compiled.

	11. Corrected detection and recovery from failed 'shorten' 
	    decompression execution.

	12. Added a new option '-c' to 'h_edit' to compute a checksum and
	    add the checksum to a specified sphere-headered file.
